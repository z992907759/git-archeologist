## Answer (Evidence-Driven)
Evidence Hashes: none
Conclusion: I don't know (insufficient evidence in commit message/diff).

## Limitations
- Query did not include a concrete file path; target detection may be weak.
- Symbol was detected but could not be resolved to a line number.
- Retrieved commit messages are generic, so why-level intent may be under-specified.
